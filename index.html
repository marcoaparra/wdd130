            <p>Hello! I'm Marco Parra and I'm pathway student.
                I have been married for three years and we have a two years old little girl. I work as TI specialist as
                part
                of a team in a real state company and I'm constantly helping othes to understand how the technology
                works and specially teaching about how to use it and solving its problems with it.
                I like to play videogames, see movies, series and share moments with my family. I like to eat whatever
                that
                my wife cooks (she is a really good cooker) and enjoy see her use and practice her talents.
                My purpose learning about programming and other technologies is become a good provider for my family and
                also teach to others how to use it and make easier their lifes. Other purpose is teach them how to be
                connected and keep
                safe, because we have an increase of attacks directed to our old people.</p>
